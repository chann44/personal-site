Hello my name is Vikash Growing up in Rajasthan, India, I was always fascinated by the natural world and the mysteries of biology. It was no surprise when I decided to pursue a degree in botany, and I graduated in 2020 with a strong foundation in the subject.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lot of changes and free time into my life. As I was stuck at home, I found myself with a lot of extra hours to fill and started watching documentaries to pass the time. One in particular caught my attention: ["Internet's Own Boy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ&ab_channel=moviemaniacsDE) a film about Aaron Swartz, a programmer and internet activist who fought for open access to information.

As I watched, I was struck by Aaron's passion for his work and the impact he was able to make on the world through programming. I realized that I wanted to feel the same sense of purpose and drive in my own career. So, I made the decision to become a programmer.

I started learning as much as I could, focusing on frontend development and experimenting with technologies like Nextjs, React, Tailwindcss, Rust, and Typescript. It wasn't always easy, but I was motivated by the idea of being able to build something that could make a difference. I became a fanatical open sourceror, always on the lookout for new projects to work on and ways to improve my skills.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music and farming. If you happen to be in Jaipur, where I currently live, maybe we can grab a coffee or code together. You can see a list of my full projects [here](/projects). .

Outside of programming, I am also passionate about dreaming up new ideas and making them a reality. There is nothing quite like the feeling of bringing a project from concept to completion, and I am constantly learning new things as I work.

You can find me on  [GitHub](https://github.com/chann44) and [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/44_chann), I am always happy to connect with other programmers and learn from each other.
