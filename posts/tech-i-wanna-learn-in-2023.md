## Intro

This post is inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCCaYEG5KeA&ab_channel=BenAwad) by `Ben Awad` in which he discusses his learning objectives for the coming year.I'm writing this blog post to make a plan for myself and to document my learning journey on this blog.Whatever I explore in the coming year, I want to document it in a series of blog posts.In this post, I'll talk about the specific things I want to learn and discuss my strategies for getting there.

## Technologies I Want To Learn

I have a tendency to lose focus and jump from one thing to the next, so this year I want to focus on learning fewer things in considerable depth.
I have specific project ideas in mind which will require the use of specific technologies, so my goal is to learn these technologies not merely for the sake of learning them, but also to be able to use them effectively in my projects.
I want to be able to use the technologies I've learned this year more effectively, as well as write about them.

here is the tech..

1. tRPC
2. Next js 13
3. Testing in Javascript and React (jest / React Testing library)
4. Typescrpt
5. Docker
6. Animation
7. Zustand + Jotai
8. Rust (compillers and parsers)
9. TanStack Query

Many of these i have tried and used in some project but i want to learn more and deep dive.

### tRPC

it's an alternative to traditional `REST` or `GraphQL`, [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs) allows you to easily build & consume fully `typesafe APIs` without schemas or code generation.

As a side project this year, I'd like to develop an idea for a social media platform.I intend to use [T3Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) to build it.While I have used `T3Stack` in the past, I am not confident in my understanding of it, so I want to focus on improving my understanding of it. I'd like to learn more about `tRPC` and how to use it effectively in my project.This will allow me to fill any knowledge gaps and use `T3Stack` more effectively.

### NEXT JS

I'm currently using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) for all of my projects and at work, but I'm not completely familiar with all of its components and patterns.
I'd like to gain a better understanding of these topics, especially in light of the new features and patterns introduced in [Next.js version 13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/upgrade-guide) this year(2022).

### Testing

I've been writing code for the past two years, but I haven't given testing a high priority because most of it has been for side projects and because the programmers I work with at my job don't emphasise testing.
Recently, though, I've came to the realization how crucial testing is and how it can help me write better code.
I've talked to a few senior developers who also emphasise the value of test-driven development (TDD), so I've made the decision to give it a shot this year.

### Typescript

In order to fully utilise TypeScript in my Nextjs apps, I am eager to learn more about it this year.I currently use the `any` type here and there and have some knowledge gaps, but i wanna go fully `typesafe` this year. An extra thank you to[Matt Pocock](https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for his beneficial tool, [Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/).

### Docker

I am interested in learning more about deployment and using containers, and am considering using `Docker`. I have not previously done any deployments on a server, and have only used platforms like `Vercel`. I am particularly excited about learning about Docke

### Animations

I work alot with front-end and I understand the importance of animations for user experience. However, I have not yet properly learned about animations. This year, I plan to focus on learning about animations and am considering using `Framer Motion`.

### Zustand / Jotai

Currently, I manage state in my React applications using `reducers` and the `Context API`.But I want to explore different state management patterns and libraries.Given that [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) and [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) employ different methodologies and are appropriate for various application types, I am curious to learn more about them.
Although I had thought about learning `Redux Toolkit`, I am not as enthusiastic about it and would prefer to concentrate on studying Zustand and Jotai.

### Rust

Because Rust is so popular and will help me better understand fundamental programming ideas like pointers and memory management, I'm eager to learn more about it.I have experience with Python and JavaScript, but I've never looked into low-level programming.
A `terminal-based Markdown edito`r with `rich text editing capabilities` is something I'd like to build in the future.and [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an excellent learning tool

### TanStack Query

[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview#motivation) is data-fetching library for React it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.
I am excited to learn about this React Query because it can greatly simplify the process of managing state and fetching data. It allows for the invalidation and refetching of data, and can cache it as well. I am looking forward to using this in projects
I want to give a big shoutout to [Dominik](https://twitter.com/tkdodo) for his excellent series, ["Practical React Query"](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/practical-react-query).

## Done!!!

I'm excited to learn about and use these technologies, and I'll keep you updated on my projects and progress.I'm looking forward to talking more about these in the future.

Btw `Rust is object-oriented`, That's it for Today Byee ðŸ‘‹
