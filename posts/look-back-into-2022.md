I've experienced highs and lows, met new people, and learned alot of things . I've grown and changed in ways I could have never predicted, and as I look back on this past year, I can't help but feel grateful for all the experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today.

So join me on a journey through my life in 2022. From the mundane to the extraordinary, I'll be sharing my thoughts, feelings, and memories with you as we take a look back at this past year together. Here's to hoping that the next year brings even more growth, adventure, and self-discovery.

On November 15, 2022, the global population reached a milestone of 8 billion people. This is a significant moment in human history, and it's worth taking a moment to reflect on all that we've accomplished as a species. Despite the challenges and difficulties we've faced along the way, we've come a long way in the relatively short time we've been on this planet. And with so much talent, creativity, and potential at our fingertips, the possibilities for the future are truly endless. As we move forward into the next phase of human evolution, let's embrace the diversity and potential of our global community, and work together to create a brighter future for all.

Oh boy, what a wild ride it's been! Who would have thought that the biggest news of the year would be the acquisition of a little social media platform called Twitter? But leave it to Elon Musk to turn a simple business transaction into a high-stakes drama worthy of a blockbuster movie.

The story goes like this: after months of speculation and anticipation, Elon Musk finally made his move and acquired Twitter for a staggering $44 billion. It was a bold move, to say the least, and one that sent shockwaves through the tech industry.

But the real drama came when the details of the deal were revealed. As it turns out, Musk had to outmaneuver a host of rival suitors and navigate a complex web of negotiations in order to seal the deal. It was a battle for the ages, and one that tested Musk's mettle as a businessman and dealmaker.

In the end, however, it all paid off. Twitter is now firmly in the hands of Elon Musk, and the future looks bright for both the platform and its new owner. Who knows what other wild adventures are in store for the tech mogul? One thing is for sure: it's going to be an exciting ride.

At the start of this year, web3 and cryptocurrency seemed to be the talk of the town, with many people excited about the potential of these new technologies. However, the hype train came to a crashing halt when the SBF crypto exchange FTX was exposed for fraud and using its customers' money to fund its sister companies. This caused a ripple effect, leading to a crash in Bitcoin and a loss of confidence in the web3 space. It's a reminder that, as with any new and emerging technology, it's important to do due diligence and be cautious about investing. While the future of web3 and cryptocurrency is still uncertain, this episode serves as a cautionary tale for those looking to get involved in the space.

### Russia Invades Ukraine

It was a dark day on February 24, 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, reigniting the Russo-Ukrainian War that had been simmering since 2014. The invasion was a major escalation, and it didn't take long for the conflict to escalate into a full-blown disaster.

Tens of thousands of people lost their lives as the fighting raged on, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. The situation was made even worse by the fact that the invasion triggered Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II. Millions of Ukrainians were displaced within their own country, and many more fled across the border in search of safety.

As the conflict dragged on, the world watched in horror as the death toll continued to climb. It seemed as though there was no end in sight to the violence and destruction. But despite the chaos and turmoil, there were still glimmers of hope. People on both sides of the conflict showed remarkable resilience and determination, fighting for a better future for themselves and their families.

In the end, it would take years for the dust to settle and for the wounds to begin to heal. But through it all, the people of Ukraine and Russia remained determined to rebuild and move forward, even in the face of unimaginable adversity.

## A Personal Look Back at the Past Year

This year has been full of personal growth and learning for me. I've delved into the tech industry, acquiring new skills and eventually landing a job in the field. I've also met some amazing people and forged meaningful connections. Overall, it's been a successful and fulfilling year.

### intro to Web3

At the beginning of this year, I was skeptical about the potential of web3 technology. The online discourse around it seemed to be dominated by scams and hype, and I was wary of getting involved. But as the year progressed, I had the opportunity to meet a group of individuals on discord who were genuinely passionate about the tech.

Working with them sparked a new interest in web3 for me, and I began to see the potential it had to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet. I learned so much from these individuals and was able to apply my newfound knowledge to a number of exciting projects.

Thanks to these experiences, my outlook on web3 technology has completely changed. I'm constantly amazed by the innovative projects that are being built with it. I am grateful to have met such knowledgeable and inspiring people who have opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities of web3.

### First Paid work

Two years ago, I started learning to program with almost no experience or resources. I didn't have a computer or internet access, and I had studied biology in college, so I didn't have any connections in the tech industry. I thought that it was a field only for math wizards and that I wouldn't be able to make any money from it. But I enjoyed programming, so I kept learning and improving my skills.

I was lucky enough to meet this guy ([satyam](https://twitter.com/sk1122_)) who is exceptionally smart guy who knew a lot about programming. He had an opening for an internship in a company at the time he was working in that focused on React and Firebase, two technologies that I was familiar with but not particularly confident in. Despite my doubts, I decided to take the internship and give it my best shot.

The experience ended up being incredibly rewarding. Not only did I learn a lot and improve my skills, but I also gained the confidence and experience I needed to tackle more complex projects. I even got paid for my work, which was an added bonus.

Overall, the internship was a turning point in my journey as a programmer. It gave me the opportunity to apply my knowledge and build my confidence, and it opened the door to many more exciting projects and experiences. I am grateful to have had such a valuable and enjoyable experience
